Title: The Twelve Factors

## [I. Codebase][]
### One codebase tracked in revision control, many deploys

## [II. Dependencies][]
### Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies

## [III. Config][]
### Store config in the environment

## [IV. Backing Services][]
### Treat backing services as attached resources

## [V. Build, release, run][]
### Strictly separate build and run stages

## [VI. Processes][]
### Execute the app as one or more stateless processes

## [VII. Port binding][]
### Export services via port binding

## [VIII. Concurrency][]
### Scale out via the process model

## [IX. Disposability][]
### Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown

## [X. Dev/prod parity][]
### Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible

## [XI. Logs][]
### Treat logs as event streams

## [XII. Admin processes][]
### Run admin/management tasks as one-off processes
