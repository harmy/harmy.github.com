Title: About

I am a 25 year-old software developer who specializes in web application development using [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/). I have worked at all levels of the web stack, including front-end and back-end development, and system administration.

I always strive to write clean, maintainable code, and I follow standards, best practices, and common idioms where applicable. My primary technical interests revolve around web application architecture and scalability.

I was born and raised in Southern California, and I currently live in [Escondido](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escondido,_California) with my wife and daughter. I work at [Cuker Interactive](http://www.cukerinteractive.com/), where I mainly develop and maintain ecommerce websites for small and medium-sized businesses.

This site is powered by [Pythons](http://python.org/), [Pelicans](http://pelican.readthedocs.org/), and [Octocats](https://github.com/dmpayton/dmpayton.github.com).
